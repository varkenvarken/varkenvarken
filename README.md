# Hi

I am Michel Anders and I am a developer, writer and educator.

My most visible achievements to date are [my books](https://michelanders.nl/my-books/) and Blender add-ons: they were available on [BlenderMarket](https://blendermarket.com/creators/varkenvarken), [Smashwords](https://www.smashwords.com/profile/view/varkenvarken) and [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/books/info/authors/michel-anders) and major online retailers.

But lately I turned away from these activities to focus on different subjects. Most of them are not Blender related, but I am in the process of open sourcing the add-ons I previously sold on BlenderMarket, and those will appear in repositories here on GitHub. The ones available already are:

  - [Snap!](https://blog.michelanders.nl/2025/04/snap-add-on-for-blender-is-now-free.html), a time saving tool for people who often work with modular assets packs or creators of asset packs who want to make their product easier to use.
  - [Weightlifter](https://blog.michelanders.nl/2025/05/weightlifter-add-on-for-blender-is-now-free.html), a Swiss army knife of recording mesh attributes to vertex weights or -colors.
  - [IDMapper](https://blog.michelanders.nl/2025/08/idmapper-add-on-for-blender-is-now-free.html), IDMapper simplifies creation and editing of vertex color layers that can be used as ID-maps in texturing software like Substance Painter or Quixel.

I'll try and keep those add-ons up to date (no promises), but bug fixes, enhancements etc. from anyone are welcome too: just issue a PR on their respective repositories.

I also started a [new project/GitHub repo](https://varkenvarken.github.io/blenderaddons-ng/) and a [series of blog articles](https://blog.michelanders.nl/2025/06/new-blenderaddons-repository-aimed-at-developers.html) with the aim to help people professionalize their Blender add-on development. The focus is on maintainability, including automated testing and profiling, all within a a well defined Docker container that doubles as a vscode development container.

## Latest

I started a [video series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxyAbGpHucHZs5InOs_9-apX7wBIQtrrJ&si=RZhKSYvPeT6FovdW) about Blender add-on development. The source code for the example add-ons we show can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/varkenvarken/Blender-add-on-development).
